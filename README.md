# makeproject
You have to have node js installed for this.<br>
In the terminal, type<br>
<code>node makeproject.js [project_id]</code><br>
where project_id is the id of your project. For example if you want to create project for USCS-3120 then type<br>
<code>node makeproject.js 3120</code><br>
Now a new folder by the name 3120 will be created. Inside this folder contents of this project's repository will be cloned.
